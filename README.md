# BMR Calculator (Python)

**Author:** Afsheen Golanbar  

## About
This is a Python project that calculates Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and daily nutritional needs 
(calories, protein, carbs, fat, sugar) based on user input (height, weight, age, gender).  

The project was built to demonstrate my continued activity in software development 
after earning my Associate Degree in Software Programming (Islamic Azad University).  
It also supports my current application for further studies in the U.S.  

## How to Run

```bash
python3 bmr_calculator_afsheen.py

Daily calories: 2850
Protein: 144.0 grams
Carbs: 391.9 grams
Fat: 79.2 grams
